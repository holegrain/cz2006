# LibRSS
LibRSS is a tool for people to search books based on either the information about the book (e.g., author, published year etc.), or by plots where they can input a short summary of content they would like to read. It provides a solution for the common problem where one does not have a specific book in mind but wishes to read about certain types of stories and genre is too broad to search by. 

Additionally, it acts as a book cataloging website where users can rate, save, share or get recommendations about books available on the website.
